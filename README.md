# WritersWorkflow

## Requirements
- OSX / Linux
- Pandoc

This provides an example for tracking writing using a git + markdown flow without any need for specialized / expensive software. Provided are scripts for exporting short stories to docx. The exports are based on the [William Shunn format](https://format.ms/story.html). By editing the reference.docx, other formats could be easily supported. The shell scripts are very basic and meant only as an example. Very welcome would be pull requests to improve/generalize the scripts.

Full documentation/examples are provided at [WritersWorkflow/WritersWorkflow.md](WritersWorkflow/WritersWorkflow.md).
